### What is the Young Learners Workshop (YLW)?

YLW promotes code literacy among school students with Python programming language using engaging hardware (ex: Raspberry Pi devices). This is an opportunity for students, teachers to learn from each other and from the Indian Python community to cultivate their programming, communication and technology skills.

The workshop brings students, teachers from different schools to be part of the PyCon India conference that's home to Python practitioners and enthusiasts from all over India.

Each student's workstation will be setup with a Raspberry Pi device. At the end of the workshop, students get to share their learnings from the workshop.
