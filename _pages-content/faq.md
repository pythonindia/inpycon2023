### What is PyCon India?

PyCon India is the annual gathering of Pythonistas, run by the Indian Python community, to foster the adoption of the Python programming language. PyCon India 2023, will take place in Hyderabad, between 29 Sept - 02 Oct. This will be the 14th edition of the conference.

### The conference days will be divided into the following events:

#### September 29, 2023: Workshops
Workshops will be 3 hrs long interactive sessions where attendees can learn by doing. Workshops will be held on September 29, 2023 across two morning & evening sessions. We may have up to 3 parallel workshops in each session. The morning session will run from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM. The evening session will run from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

#### September 30 - October 1, 2023: Talks, Poster sessions, Lightning Talks, Open Spaces, Sponsor Stalls
1. Talks will be where people do a 30 min talk, on a topic. These talks are selected through a CFP process, before the event. Talks will be held across the morning & evening sessions on September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2023. We may have up to 4 parallel tracks of talks in each session. The morning session will run from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM. The evening session will run from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM.

2. Poster session is a 1-hour session during which presenters use a graphic poster and a laptop to present their topic.

3. Open spaces are where people have informal presentations and discussions alongside the talk tracks. Open spaces slots can be booked at the venue, on the day of the event.

4. Lightning talks is a 1-hour session. Lightning talks are rapid 5 min presentations, presented to the entire conference crowd, a great way to get a message across to the entire audience.

5. Sponsor stalls are where you can meet companies supporting the conference. These companies use Python and are looking for Python developers. You can visit their stalls to get to know more about them, and the openings in their organization.

#### October 2, 2023: Devsprints
During the Devsprints, people contribute to open-source projects, guided by mentors. This is a nice way to get started with contributing to Python and other open-source projects.

Devsprints are free to attend.
