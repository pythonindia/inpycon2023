title: Job Board - Rules and Guidelines
---

### Job Submission and Approval Process:

- We do not impose any restrictions on the industry/technology of the submitted jobs. Any jobs that are helpful to the community are welcome.
- After successful job submission, each job will undergo a verification process by the PyCon India 2023 team to ensure there are no spam postings.
- The approval process may take approximately 3-4 days.
- Approved jobs will be made visible on the job board once they pass the verification process.
- Submissions that do not meet the guidelines may be rejected, and submitters will be notified of the reasons for rejection.
- If the position you posted has been filled, and you are no longer taking applications, please let the team know, so we can take down your posting.
- The job board will stay up for the community even after the conference is over.

### Job Posts Order:

- Job posts are sorted based on the timestamp they are submitted. The first job submitted will be visible first, followed by subsequent submissions in chronological order.

### Transparency:

- The PyCon India 2023 job board is provided solely as a platform for job listings and does not have any direct connection to the hiring or recruitment process.
- Job seekers and companies are encouraged to communicate directly with each other for job-related inquiries, applications, and hiring decisions.

### Content Moderation:

- PyCon India 2023 reserves the right to moderate and remove job posts that violate submission guidelines or community standards.
- Users are encouraged to report any inappropriate content or issues with job posts for review.

### Respect and Inclusivity:

- Users are expected to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment when interacting with job listings or other users on the platform.
- Any kind of disrespectful, discriminatory, or offensive behavior against any party will not be tolerated.
- Please make sure to follow PyCon India's [Code of Conduct](https://in.pycon.org/2023/code-of-conduct/).
- If you feel unsafe during any of the interactions, or feel like someone is violating the rules, please [report the incident to the CoC Workgroup](https://in.pycon.org/2023/reporting-guide/).

Disclaimer: PyCon India 2023 is not responsible for the accuracy, quality, or legitimacy of job listings, and users should exercise their discretion when applying for jobs.
