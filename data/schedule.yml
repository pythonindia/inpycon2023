              about:
                A Jack-of-all-trades with a Masters in Computer Science and a Minor in Data Science. I graduated from UMASS Amherst in 2018 and am currently working a Staff Data Scientist. My undergrad was done from BITS Pilani. I love solving puzzles/ciphers, deductive reasoning and tackling real-world challenges that require learning and combining different concepts. I aimed to be a generalist across all the subfields and domains of AI, but have limited my current expertise to GNNs, RL and Deep NLP.<br>
                My name is a palindrome, and I’m a polymath and a polyglot (First Language is Python🐉 ). Life is a constant struggle between being a member of the community and standing out as an individual. I find a balance between both.
