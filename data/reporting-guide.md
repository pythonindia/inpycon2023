At PyCon India 2023, we are committed to providing a safe and welcoming
environment for all attendees. We take incidents of harassment, misconduct, or
violations of our [Code Of Conduct](../code-of-conduct) very seriously. This
Reporting Guide aims to provide clear instructions on how to report any concerns
and the steps we will take to address reported incidents.

### Reporting Process

If you experience any harassment, or unfair treatment, or witness any
behavior you believe violates the PyCon India [Code Of Conduct](../code-of-conduct),
we encourage you to report it as soon as possible. Reports can be made through the
following channels:

a. **Contact a Volunteer:** Look for individuals wearing "PyCon India Volunteer"
badges and approach them to make your report in person.

b. **Email:** You can send an email to
[coc@in.pycon.org](mailto:coc@in.pycon.org) to submit your report
electronically.

c. **In-person:** If you prefer to discuss the matter in person, please notify
any member of the PyCon India organizing team or the Code Of Conduct Committee.

### Information to Include in Your Report

When filing a report, please provide as much relevant information as possible.
The following details are essential to help us understand and address the
situation:

- **Your contact information:** So we can get in touch with you if additional
  information is needed during the investigation.

- **Names and details of involved parties:** Include the names (real, nicknames,
  or pseudonyms) of all individuals involved in the incident, including any
  witnesses.

- **Date, time, and location of the incident:** Be as specific as possible about
  when and where the incident occurred.

- **Description of the incident:** Provide a detailed account of what happened,
  including any offensive language or actions involved.

- **Evidence, if available:** If there is any publicly available evidence (e.g.,
  screenshots, recordings, links to relevant discussions), please include them
  in your report.

- **Additional context:** Share any context you believe might be relevant to the
  incident.

- **Is the incident ongoing?:** Let us know if the incident is ongoing or if
  there is an immediate threat to someone's safety.

### Confidentiality

All reports will be treated with strict confidentiality. We understand the
sensitive nature of such matters and will protect the privacy of all parties
involved to the best of our ability. In some cases, we may need to make a public
statement, but the identities of victims and reporters will remain confidential
unless instructed otherwise.

### Reporting Concerns about Volunteers or Organizers

If your report concerns a possible violation by a volunteer or organizer, you
can make your report directly to the Chair of the Code Of Conduct Committee,
whose contact information will be made available during the conference.The current
Chair is Nivesh Krishna, and you can reach out via email at
vniveshkrishna.98 at gmail dot com

### Response and Resolution

Once a report is received, the Code Of Conduct Committee will promptly initiate
an investigation. The Diversity working group will review the incident, consider
all the information provided, and determine the appropriate response. Possible
responses may include but are not limited to:

- No violation found: If the incident does not violate the
  [Code Of Conduct](../code-of-conduct).

- Private reprimand: A private warning to the individual(s) involved.

- Public reprimand: A public statement addressing the violation.

- Expulsion: Removal from the conference without a refund.

- Ban from PyCon India spaces: Temporary or permanent restrictions on access to
  mailing lists, IRC, etc.

- Request for an apology: Asking the responsible party to issue an apology to
  the affected individuals or the community.

### Timeline

We aim to respond to the reporter within one week of receiving the report with
either a resolution or an explanation of the ongoing investigation.

### Retaliation

PyCon India strictly prohibits any form of retaliation against individuals who
report incidents in good faith. We are committed to creating a safe environment
for everyone, and retaliation will not be tolerated.
