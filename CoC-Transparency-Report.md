# PyCon India 2023 Transparency Report

## Code of Conduct Incidents

### Introduction

PyCon India 2023 is committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all participants, regardless of their background, experience, or identity. Our Code of Conduct (CoC) is designed to ensure a safe and respectful conference experience for everyone. This transparency report aims to document any incidents related to the CoC during PyCon India 2023 and the actions taken in response.

### Reporting Process

We take Code of Conduct violations seriously and have a clear reporting process in place. Attendees were encouraged to report any incidents they experienced or witnessed through multiple channels, including in-person staff, email, and an online reporting form. Reports were collected and handled by our dedicated CoC committee.

### Incidents

As of 7th October 2023, there were a total of 4 incidents reported during PyCon India 2023 related to the Code of Conduct. These incidents can be categorized as follows:

1. Harassment (2 incidents): Two reports of harassment, including inappropriate comments and unwelcome advances, were received during the conference. All reports involved individuals interacting in person.

2. Social Media Misconduct (1 incident): There was one reported incident of offensive social media posts made by an attendee, which violated the CoC.

3. Religious Symbol Display (1 incident): A report was received regarding the display of a religious symbol on stage by the AV vendor during the lamp lighting ceremony.

### Actions Taken

Upon receiving these reports, the CoC committee promptly took the following actions:

1. Harassment Incidents: For the two harassment incidents, the committee conducted thorough investigations, which included speaking to both the complainants and the accused individuals. In all cases, the committee determined that CoC violations had occurred. The following actions were taken:
   - A formal warning was issued to the accused individuals, reminding them of the CoC and the consequences of further violations.
   - All parties involved were provided with information on how to contact the CoC committee in case of any further issues.

2. Social Media Misconduct Incident: The individual responsible for the offensive social media posts was contacted and informed that their posts violated the CoC. They were asked to remove the offending content, which they promptly did. The individual was reminded of the scope of the conference CoC and that social media was well within the ambits of the CoC.

3. Religious Symbol Display Incident: The CoC committee investigated the incident regarding the display of a religious symbol on stage by the AV vendor during the lamp lighting ceremony. It was determined that this action violated the CoC, and PyCon India always aims to be neutral. Hence, the following actions were taken:
   - The AV vendor was immediately questioned, and they agreed that they put up the religious image during the Diya Lighting Ceremony, as they assumed it was a general protocol in colleges.
   - After instructions, the AV vendor assured organizers that they would not be putting any such image on the main screen without notifying organizers.
   - The PyCon India Chair provided clarification on the issue of the oversight the next day during the Opening Address.
   - The CoC committee guided to all vendors regarding appropriate behaviour and adherence to the CoC.
   - A clarification post was made in public on social media from the official handle of PyCon India regarding the same. [Here is the link to the tweet](https://x.com/pyconindia/status/1708350063381254209?s=20)

The PyCon India team is committed to maintaining a safe and inclusive environment for all attendees. We take Code of Conduct violations seriously and are grateful to those who came forward to report incidents. We believe in resolving such incidents fairly and promptly, with the aim of fostering a positive and respectful community.

We will continue to improve our policies and procedures based on the lessons learned during this event. Feedback and suggestions regarding our Code of Conduct and reporting process are always welcome and can be sent to [coc@in.pycon.org](mailto:coc@in.pycon.org).

We hope that PyCon India 2023 has been a valuable and enjoyable experience for all participants, and we look forward to seeing you at future events.
